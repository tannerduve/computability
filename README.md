A formalization of computability theory in Lean. 

Roadmap:
1. Define Turing reducibility - Done
2. Prove equivalence relation - Done with refl and symm (trivial), working on transitivity
3. Define Turing degrees
4. Prove properties of Turing degrees (uncountable, upper semilattice)
5. Formalize Jump Construction
6. Kleene-Post theorem
7. Possibly: Complexity theory OR computable algebra
