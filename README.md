A formalization of computability theory in Lean. 

Roadmap:
1. Define Turing reducibility - Done
2. Prove equivalence relation - Done
3. Define Turing degrees - In progress
4. Prove properties of Turing degrees (uncountable, upper semilattice)
5. Develop encoding for partial recursive functions
6. Formalize Jump Construction
7. Kleene-Post theorem
7. Possibly: Complexity theory OR computable algebra
