A formalization of computability theory in Lean. 

Roadmap:
1. Define Turing reducibility - Done
2. Prove equivalence relation - Done
3. Define Turing degrees - Done
4. Develop encoding for relativized partial recursive functions - Done
5. Define Jump - Done
6. Relativize theorems about encoding/universal machine - In progress
7. Prove properties of Turing degrees (uncountable, upper semilattice) - In progress
8. Prove Jump theorems
9. Kleene-Post theorem (There exists incomparable degrees)
10. Possibly: Complexity theory OR computable algebra
- 6, 7, 8 can be worked on concurrently, don't seem to depend on one another

To do (in any order) : 
- Figure out proof that evalo is a universal relativized PR function, and prove relativized theorems (fixed point, rices theorem)
- Figure out how to lift reduce and jump to degrees, prove upper semilattice
- Figure out how to lift join to degrees, prove resulting properties
