A formalization of computability theory in Lean. 

Roadmap:
1. Define Turing reducibility - Done
<<<<<<< HEAD
2. Prove equivalence relation - Done with refl and symm (trivial), working on transitivity
3. Define Turing degrees + lift relations to Turing degrees

>>>>>>> c508868ef9078c2d349eda275dbdfff524e5f1d0
4. Prove properties of Turing degrees (uncountable, upper semilattice)
5. Formalize Jump Construction
6. Kleene-Post theorem
7. Possibly: Complexity theory OR computable algebra
